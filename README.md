# Simple-Kanban
 A simple Kanban To-Do list board made with Java Servlets

Made using Java Servlets. Kanban lets you create to do lists and keep advancing them until ther are compleated. 
You can easily create new taks and delete them.You can also change the task priorities and rearrange them as you wish. 
I have added some simple started tasks just as a filler that can be easily removed.
